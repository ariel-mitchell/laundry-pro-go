        <p>This page will render a calendar view of all orders, based on pickup date (may also add a dropoff date and span across all days). Users will be able to filter to see
            all orders or only orders from their regulars. In the future, this feature would ideally be able to predict when a regular will be putting in another order based on 
            patterns.
